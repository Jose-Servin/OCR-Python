# OCR with Python

## Common OCR Workflow

1. PIL (Pillow) --> Open an image

   - Converts images to numerical arrays for processing.
   - Called using `import PIL`
   - Most often `from PIL import Image`
   - Use Pillow for:
     - open an image
     - pass an image to tesseract.
     - saving an image.
     - simple image manipulations like cropping.

2. OpenCSV --> Change an image

   - Called using `import cv2`
   - Syntax is a bit difficult to understand; patience needed.
   - High computation cost.
   - Use OpenCV for:
     - binarization of an image.
     - controlling image threshold.

3. Tesseract (PyTesseract) --> OCR an image

   - Two part installation process
     1. Install Tesseract via brew
     2. Install Python-Tesseract package

Reminder: "By nature, every OCR is to a degree "custom" - they have to be to insure accuracy. So best practices might have to be overlooked in the initial experimentation phase."

Reminder: "An image is a series of numerical arrays that represent pixels."
